RNG2DTD To Dos:

** topic-info-types not being declared.

2. Pull {typename}-attlist into main {typename)-attributes:

<!ENTITY % concept.attlist
              "(%concept.attributes;
                %arch-atts;)" 
>

6. Declaration for no-topic-nesting attributes. Should be an empty replacement text rather
   than no declaration at all.
   

8. Generate catalogs

RNG2XSD To Dos:


- Put commonElements and metaDecl inclusions in shells, not topicMod.xsd

- Include *.attlist in main .attributes group
