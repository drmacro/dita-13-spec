# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#           * <Equivalent>
#           * <torso>

## an extension point for alternate spellings and internationalization of the equivalence tag name.  
Equivalent-node.choice |= Equivalent.Node.def

## An equivalence expression, which is "syntactic sugar" for a pair of conjoined converse implication rules (<Implies>). 
## It consists of a pair of (optionally skipped) <torso> roles. 
## For example, "A person owning an object is equivalent to an object belonging to a person":

## Equivalences may have an optional closure attribute 
## and will accept a scoped closure attribute at full first-order logic.

## Equivalences optionally accept the header pattern common to Nodes.

# For the declaration of the Node header, see the serialization modules ((un)ordered_groups_expansion_module).

## the main content model of equivalances consists of two "torso" formulas
Equivalent.main |= torso-edge.choice, torso-edge.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as alternate spellings and internationalization of the torso tag name in equivalences.

##  A symmetric role used in an equivalence expression (<Equivalent>) combining the asymmetric <then> and <if>.

  element torso { torso.attlist? & torso.content }

## An equivalance is syntactic sugar for two implications.
## In all RuleML languages, formulas allowed as premises are the same or more general than those allowed as conclusions,
## because this is a requirement for the statement "P implies P" to be syntactically valid whenever P is a valid conclusion.
## Therefore, formulas allowed in equivalences are the same as those allowed in conclusions.
torso.content |= ConclusionFormula.choice
# For the declaration of the conclusion pattern, see the implication module (implication_expansion_module).
