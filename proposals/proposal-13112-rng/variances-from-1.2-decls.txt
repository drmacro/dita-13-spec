Variances from 1.2 DTD declarations:

1. Formatting of declarations standardized across modules

2. Using "-type" in place of "-typemod" for structural modules

3. Omitting use of : 
<!ENTITY % hazard.cnt 
  "#PCDATA | 
   %basic.ph; | 
   %sl; | 
   %simpletable;"
>

in hazardstatementDomain.mod--only used in one element type, no point in preserving.

4. The element name entity declarations for metaDecl.mod are in metaDecl.mod, not commonElements.ent.

5. Omitted revision-specific comments. They are available in the 1.2 distribution for historical purposes.

Variances from 1.2 XSD declarations

1. commonElement*.xsd becomes commonElements*.xsd (or should we preserve the 1.2 naming convention)?

2. Attribute declarations for enumerated attributes are all repeated for each declaration of the attribute,
   rather than using the separate attribute class declarations. In looking at the XSDs I don't think the use
   of the classes is actually warranted by the DITA design because each element type may choose to constrain
   each of its attributes in any way it wants.
   
3. Name all domain modules with *Mod.xsd per spec.   

4. Where element content models have two levels of sequence nesting, the generated declarations only have one
  (this is equivalent to having double parens in a DTD, e.g. ((foo, bar)) as opposed to (foo, bar). The two
  are functionally equivalent.
