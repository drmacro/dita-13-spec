Variances from 1.2 DTD declarations:

0. Formatting of declarations standardized across modules

1. Using "-type" in place of "-typemod" for structural modules

2. Omitting use of : 
<!ENTITY % hazard.cnt 
  "#PCDATA | 
   %basic.ph; | 
   %sl; | 
   %simpletable;"
>

in hazardstatementDomain.mod--only used in one element type, no point in preserving.

3. The element name entity declarations for metaDecl.mod are in metaDecl.mod, not commonElements.ent.

4. Omitted revision-specific comments. They are available in the 1.2 distribution for historical purposes.
