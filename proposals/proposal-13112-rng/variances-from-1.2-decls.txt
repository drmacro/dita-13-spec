Variances from 1.2 DTD declarations:

1. Formatting of declarations standardized across modules

2. Using "-type" in place of "-typemod" for structural modules

3. Omitting use of : 
<!ENTITY % hazard.cnt 
  "#PCDATA | 
   %basic.ph; | 
   %sl; | 
   %simpletable;"
>

in hazardstatementDomain.mod--only used in one element type, no point in preserving.

4. The element name entity declarations for metaDecl.mod are in metaDecl.mod, not commonElements.ent.

5. Omitted revision-specific comments. They are available in the 1.2 distribution for historical purposes.

Variances from 1.2 XSD declarations

1. commonElement*.xsd becomes commonElements*.xsd (or should be preserve the 1.2 naming convention)?
