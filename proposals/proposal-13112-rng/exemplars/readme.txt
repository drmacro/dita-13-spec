Contains exemplars of 1.2 and 1.3 files that the
generated files should match to one degree or 
another.

These exemplars have been modified from the original
1.2 distributions to reflect allowed variances, such
as order of names in declarations where order is no 
important or to normalize white space. See the "variances"
documentation.
