Subject: Re: Proposal 13118 reviewDate: Saturday, July 6, 2013 4:08 AMFrom: Nancy Harrison <nancylph@gmail.com>To: Richard Hamilton <hamilton@xmlpress.net>Cc: Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com>Conversation: Proposal 13118 reviewThe Stage 2 proposal was the only one I found at the Stage 3 sitealso; that's why I built a Stage 3 version (as well as to see what theexample looked like with the Japanese text).Yes, a link to the HTML5 ruby material would be very helpful.  Weprobably will need to include it in our list of normative referencesin the spec in any case for copyright reasons.Regards,NancyOn Thu, Jul 4, 2013 at 2:22 PM, Richard Hamilton <hamilton@xmlpress.net> wrote:> Hi Nancy and Eliot,>> It does look like I got the Stage 2 PDF rather than the Stage 3, though I did get it from the Stage 3 link:>> https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/dita/document.php?document_id=49797>> I just read through the Stage 3 proposal that Nancy created and only have one additional comment: I think it would be useful to have a link to the HTML5 definition for <ruby>.>> Also, it looks like you addressed all of the comments I put in the Stage 2 PDF.
