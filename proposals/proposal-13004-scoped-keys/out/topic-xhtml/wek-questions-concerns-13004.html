  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Questions/Issues/Observations on 13004 Scoped Keys</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">Questions/concerns rising from my attempt to apply scoped keys to a
      real-world example.</p>

    <ol class="ol" id="topic_s4k_q5r_vj__ol_qh2_t5r_vj">
      <li class="li">Should it be possible for the same scope to have multiple keyscope
        names? That would make it possible to have the same physical scope
        referenced by different qualified names. This would be parallel with
        @keys.<div class="p">Without this I don't see a way to alias a scope with a
        different key scope, unless you can do something
        like:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;topicref keyscope="scope-y" keyref="scope-x-root"/&gt;
&lt;topicref keyscope="scope-x" keys="scope-x-root"&gt;
  ... keys defined in scope-x ...
&lt;/topicref&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">Would
        the above be taken to mean that references to "scope-y.foo" resolve to
        keys defined in scope "scope-x"? I don't think that behavior is
        necessary from the current proposal.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">When there are scopes, topics intended for use within a scope have to
        know when to use unscoped keys and scoped keys. That is, authors of
        topics will need to know which references are to keys that are expected
        to be local to whatever scope the topic is used in and which are not
        local. I think this is reasonable but it bears repeating. I think this
        case is the same as for cross-publication links. You either know your
        link is *always* cross-scope or cross-publication or you don't. If you
        don't you assume it is local to the current scope or publication. I
        suppose for keys for which authors are unsure they could use a third
        qualifier like "possibly-scoped" and let the using map author sort it
        out.<p class="p">I think this ends up being a question of how topic authors come
        to know about the keys they should use when creating references. One
        would expect that there are normally business rules in effect, possibly
        enforced or guided by authoring or content management systems.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">If I have a map that specifies @keyscope and then include that map via
        mapref, I really want to be able to specify the key scope name on the
        mapref so that I know, given only the declarations in the local map,
        what the keyspace name used for peer map is--meaning I don't have to
        dereference the peer map and examine it in order to discover that it
        defines a scope (which I need to know in order to process key references
        in the context of the local map).<p class="p">I think this means that when a
        &lt;mapref&gt; element specifies @keyscope it establishes a name for the
        scope defined by the referenced map. If the referenced map also
        specifies @keyscope, it establishes a single-level key scope, not a two
        level keyscope. </p>
<div class="p">That is, the effect
        of:<pre class="pre codeblock">Map A:
&lt;map&gt;&lt;title&gt;Map A&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;mapref keyscope="map-b" href="map-b.ditamap"/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/map&gt;


Map B:
&lt;map keyscope="map-b"&gt;
  &lt;topicref id="ref-in-map-b"&gt;
     ...
  &lt;/topicref&gt;
  ...
&lt;/map&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">is
        equivalent
        to:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;map&gt;&lt;title&gt;Map A&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;topicgroup keyscope="map-b"&gt;
    &lt;topicref id="ref-in-map-b"&gt;
     ...
    &lt;/topicref&gt;    
  &lt;/topicgroup&gt;
  ...
&lt;/map&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">and
        not:</p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;map&gt;&lt;title&gt;Map A&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;topicgroup keyscope="map-b"&gt;
    &lt;topicgroup keyscope="map-b"&gt;
      &lt;topicref id="ref-in-map-b"&gt;
       ...
      &lt;/topicref&gt;    
    &lt;/topicgroup&gt;
  &lt;/topicgroup&gt;
  ...
&lt;/map&gt;</pre>
<p class="p">This
        also implies that scopes defined in peer maps are <strong class="ph b">not</strong> usable from
        local maps, avoiding any requirement to do full key space construction
        of peer maps in order to resolve keyrefs from the local map.</p>
<p class="p">Given
        this rule I think it gives you same addressing facility I was trying to
        define in my cross-publication proposal, that is, a single identifier
        for the peer key space and no more.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">The practical implications for scopes defined in standalone
        keydef-containing maps could be non-obvious and tricky. There's a lot of
        indirection involved and it could get quite confusing an non-obvious
        with regard to what it means, for example, to have a &lt;keydef&gt; element
        define a scope.<p class="p">I think in that case it means that the resource
        defined by that key can only be referenced by a scope-qualified
        reference. That may not be obvious to all users.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">In the case where you have a map that defines a key scope and that map
        references a peer map and assigns it a scope (per item 3 above), then
        references to that scope still only need to be qualified with the
        peer-map's scope name, because all topics referenced from within the
        local map will be in the same (or descendant) scope context as the peer
        map reference.<p class="p">This means that if you always include your peer maps
        within your using map's root scope, then references to keys on those
        peers will always only require a single scope qualification term (e.g.,
        "peer-map.foo", <strong class="ph b">not</strong> "my-local-map-scope.peer-map.foo").</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">For Open Toolkit, with generate-outer of "2", the peer deliverable
        as-delivered maps need to be in the same directory tree as the root map,
        otherwise, the Toolkit can't find them. This means that these maps need
        to have either absolute URLs or URLs relative to the location of the
        using root map, not relative to the peer root map. When the files are
        organized in this way, the cross-deliverable links are correctly
        generated by normal toolkit processing.<p class="p">When generate-outer is "3",
        then the as-delivered maps can live with the maps they reflected, but
        the output directory will be below where it might otherwise be expected
        to be.</p>
</li>

      <li class="li">When the target of the xref is a complete topic, then if there is a
        navtitle for the keydef (which the Toolkit claims is required, which it
        probably is), then the link text used is the navtitle.<p class="p">However, if the
        target of the xref is an element within the topic (e.g., a figure), then
        the link text is the URL of the target. Not clear how to provide the
        link text in that case without modifying the xref itself, since there is
        no indirection element for the target element, only the topic. This
        supports the argument that we need an indirection facility for
        references to elements within topics as well as to topics as we have
        with keys. On the other hand, if we have to generate intermediate copies
        of all the topics then that process can also set the xref text, although
        this requires processing the peer documents in order to get the
        appropriate link texts for each target element.</p>
<p class="p">One solution might
        be to add metadata to the keydef used by the xref-to-element-with-topic
        to provide a mapping of element IDs to link text. This would be done as
        part of the process of generating the as-delivered key definitions for
        each publication. Essentially, for each element within a topic with an
        ID you'd need to generate an ID-to-link text mapping in the generated
        keydef. Hmm. You have to do all IDed elements because you can't know
        what elements might be linked to from other deliverables.</p>
