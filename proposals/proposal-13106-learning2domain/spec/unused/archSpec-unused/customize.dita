<title>Customization</title>
<shortdesc>When you just need a difference in output, you can use DITA customization
to override the default output without affecting portability or interchange,
and without involving specialization. </shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>For example, if your readers are mostly experienced users, you could concentrate
on creating many summary tables, and maximizing retrievability; or if you
needed to create a brand presence, you could customize the transforms to apply
appropriate fonts and indent style, and include some standard graphics and
copyright links.</p><?Pub Caret1?>
<p>Use customization when you need new output, with no change to the underlying
semantics (you arenâ€™t saying anything new or meaningful about the content,
only its display).</p>
