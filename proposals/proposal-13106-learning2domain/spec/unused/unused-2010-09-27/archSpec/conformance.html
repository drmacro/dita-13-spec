  <h1 class="topictitle1">Conformance</h1>

  
  <div><p>This section outlines the requirements that must be met for documents, document types,
    specialization modules, and processors to be considered DITA conforming. This section also
    defines conformance-related terminology that is used throughout the DITA
    specifications.</p>

    <p>Conformance to the DITA specifications allows documents and document types that are shared
      within and across organizations and used with different processors or different versions of a
      processor to produce the same or similar results with little or no reimplementation or
      modification.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Keywords</h2>
      
      <p>The words <span class="keyword">must</span>, <span class="keyword">must not</span>, <span class="keyword">required</span>, <span class="keyword">shall</span>, <span class="keyword">shall not</span>, <span class="keyword">should</span>, <span class="keyword">should not</span>, <span class="keyword">recommended</span>, <span class="keyword">may</span>, and <span class="keyword">optional</span> in the DITA specifications are to be
        interpreted as described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" target="_blank">IETF RFC 2119</a>.</p>

      <p>The use of these keywords and other conformance requirements increase the level of
        interoperability that is available between DITA conforming implementations. Their use is not
        meant to impose particular methods on implementers where the method is not required for
        interoperability.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Conformance statement</h2>
      
      <p>Conforming DITA implementations <span class="keyword">must</span> include a conformance statement
        that lists the DITA features that are supported by the implementation and are implemented in
        accordance with the requirements of the DITA specifications together with the version of the
        DITA specification. Or, if it is clearer, the statement <span class="keyword">may</span> say that the
        implementation includes all of the features for a particular category of implementation
        together with a list of features that are not included.</p>

      <p>Documents, document types, vocabulary modules, and processors that implement the
        requirements given in the OASIS approved DITA specifications are considered conforming.</p>

      <p>Implementations that include some DITA features, but not others, are considered conforming
        as long as all <span class="keyword">required</span> features for the category of implementation are
        included and all of the features that are included follow the requirements given in the DITA
        specification. An implementation which does not include a particular optional feature
          <span class="keyword">must</span> be prepared to interoperate with another implementation that does
        include the feature, though perhaps with reduced functionality. And, while less common, an
        implementation which does include a particular optional feature <span class="keyword">must</span> be
        prepared to interoperate with another implementation that does not include the feature.</p>

      <p>Organizations and individuals are free to impose additional constraints on their own use of
        DITA that go beyond the requirements imposed by the DITA specifications, possibly including
        enforcement of the constraints by their local tools, as long as the result continues to meet
        the requirements given in the DITA specifications. For example, a given user community could
        impose rules on how files must be named or organized even if those rules go beyond the
        requirements given in the DITA specifications.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Conformance categories</h2>
      
      <p>The following categories are used to define the amount of flexibility that is available
        when implementing specific requirements.</p>

      <dl>
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Required and invariant</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Features that <span class="keyword">must</span> be implemented exactly as defined in the DITA
              specification. This classification applies primarily to the XML syntax, DITA
              documents, the rules for creating DITA vocabulary modules and document types, and
              address resolution behavior. Example: a given address <span class="keyword">must</span> always
              resolve to the same object for the same input data set and processing conditions.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Required but variable</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Features that <span class="keyword">must</span> be implemented and for which the effective
              result <span class="keyword">must</span> be consistent with the rules as defined in the DITA
              specification but for which the specific expression may vary.</p>

          </dd>

          <dd class="ddexpand">
            <p>For example, any implementation of the content reference feature <span class="keyword">must</span> reflect the same effective result for the same input data set but
              the way that effective result is provided can vary. The content reference could be
              implemented by a pre-process step that replaces the reference by the referenced
              content or by a process that generates the functional equivalent of the content
              reference in the target output (such as a transclusion instruction in a Wiki
              page).</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Variable with defaults</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Features that <span class="keyword">may</span> produce various behaviors or outputs, but for
              which the DITA specification defines a default that all conforming implementations
                <span class="keyword">must</span> provide. </p>

            <p>Implementations are <span class="keyword">not required</span> to make the DITA-defined default
              their default. Implementations are only <span class="keyword">required</span> to provide an
              appropriate set of options or configurations that will provide the DITA-defined
              defaults. </p>

            <p>These features are primarily formatting defaults for elements where a default
              presentation is natural or expected, such as paragraphs, lists, and tables. An
              application for a specific use domain might define default formatting behaviors that
              are significantly different from the DITA-defined defaults. For example, an
              application specifically for legal information could provide a different default
              presentation from an application for technical documentation.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Variable without defaults</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Features that <span class="keyword">may</span> be implemented to produce various behaviors or
              outputs and for which the DITA specification defines no required default.</p>

            <p>The DITA specification may include examples or suggested behaviors for these features
              but such suggestions are informative, not normative.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Informative or non-normative</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>The DITA specifications include examples and other suggestions that are informative
              rather than normative. While informative information is often very helpful, it is
              never a binding part of the DITA specifications even when the example or other
              information is about a feature that is <span class="keyword">required</span>.</p>

          </dd>

        
      </dl>

      <p>If a particular conformance category is not specified for a feature and the appropriate
        category cannot be determined from the information available in the DITA specifications the
        feature <span class="keyword">must</span> be considered <em>required and invariant.</em> Unless it is
        clearly stated otherwise, examples are always informative rather than normative.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Processors and processor type categories</h2>
      
      <p>Processors that implement some DITA features, but not others, are considered conforming as
        long as the features that are implemented follow the requirements given in the DITA
        specification for those features. Processors that are not DITA aware are not considered
        conforming, but may still be useful when working with DITA.</p>

      <p>The level of conformance for a given processor can only be determined by examining the
        features that the component implements and the degree to which these features follow the
        requirements given in the DITA specifications.</p>

      <p>Because the number of possible DITA-aware processors is large, it is useful to define
        several processor type categories that can be used to define which requirements apply to
        which processors. A given processor may belong to more than one category. </p>

      <p>The DITA specifications use the following categories of processor types in defining
        processor related requirements and suggestions:</p>

      <dl>
        
          <dt class="dlterm">DITA-aware processor</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A processor that implements features defined by the DITA specifications including all
              of the required and invariant, the required but variable, the variable with defaults,
              and other requirements from the DITA specifications for the features that it
              includes.</p>

            <p>All conforming DITA processors must be specialization aware such that they are able
              to correctly produce DITA-defined behavior and processing results to any conforming
              DITA document regardless of the details of its governing document type.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">DITA editor</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>An interactive application that enables the creation and modification of conforming
              DITA documents.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Information management system</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A processor that stores and manages DITA documents in a way that takes advantage of
              DITA-specific aspects of the data in order to facilitate the management of those
              documents through a development or delivery process. Such systems may be content
              management systems that support authoring workflows or they may be retrieval systems
              that support delivery workflows.</p>

          </dd>

        
        
          <dt class="dlterm">Renderer</dt>

          <dd>
            <p>A processor that takes as input one or more conforming DITA documents and produces as
              output final-form renderings of those documents, such as HTML pages, paginated PDF,
              and compiled online help. Most simply, a DITA renderer is a processor that is directly
              responsible for producing a visual, aural, tactile, or interactive result from DITA
              content, either by providing the rendition directly or by providing direct input to
              the rendition delivery system (e.g., providing HTML content to a Web browser or
              typesetting commands to a pagination system).<div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong>Gershon <br/>Is the last sentence true? I don't thing so, in which case it
                should be deleted. For instance, what's to stop a rendering tool from taking DITA
                input and applying some built-in processing algorithm that generates a PDF
                file?</div>
<div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong>WEK <br/>Deleted sentence in question. Gershon is correct: it's not 100% true.
                I'm not sure what I was trying to get at with the sentence but it didn't add any
                real value.</div>

              must be a conforming DITA document, but the output documents are <span class="keyword">not

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Rendition categories</h2>
      
      <div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong><br/>Draft-comment: It is unclear if some or even any of these rendition categories
        will be used elsewhere in the DITA specification. If they are not used, this section will be
        deleted.</div>

      <p>Not all rendition requirements, defaults, and suggestions are relevant to all possible
        rendered outputs. The DITA specifications use the following rendition types in defining
        rendition requirements and suggestions:<div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong>Gershon <br/>I don't think we need this section. If we do keep this section, we need
          to add Eclipse, since some DITA functionality currently applies only to
          Eclipse...</div>
<div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong>WEK <br/>I think this set of categories is useful, but since we haven't taken the time
          yet to update the spec to indicate what presentation effects are required, optional, or
          default, we haven't also had a chance to apply these categories. I'm not sure Eclipse, by
          itself, is a valid category: there must be a more general category of rendition type of
          which Eclipse is perhaps the only example. That is: it could not be the case that DITA
          would have a feature that was only ever relevant for Eclipse--that would just be wrong.
          That means that any feature that was developed originally to support some feature of
          Eclipse must have a more general justification, we just have to figure out what it
          is.</div>

            <div style="background-color: #99FF99; border: 1pt black solid;"><strong>Draft comment: </strong>WEK <br/>Clarrified requirements for use of DTDs and schemas per discussion with
              MP.</div>

            <p>A conforming DITA document <span class="keyword">must</span> implement all content and
              structure requirements defined by the DITA specifications. A conforming DITA document
                <span class="keyword">may</span> directly include a conforming DITA DTD or point to a
              conforming DITA XSD. Note that conformance of a DITA document is determined by its
              adherence to the constraints and requirements defined by the vocabulary modules the
              document declares conformance to. The DITA specification and, by implication,
              conforming non-DITA-defined vocabulary modules, define requirements that cannot be
              validated by DTD or XSD validation alone. Therefore, DTD or schema validity is not
              sufficient to determine that a given document is a valid DITA document. </p>

            <p>DITA processing and conformance validation depends on the use of specific attributes
              in document instances. For local processing of DITA documents, any means by which
              those attributes are defined is acceptable. For blind interchange of documents outside
              one's local processing environment, documents <span class="keyword">must</span> either have an
              associated DTD or XSD that provides the required attribute defaults or documents
                <span class="keyword">must</span> make all defaulted attributes explicit in the document
              instance.</p>

            <p>Conforming DITA processors <span class="keyword">must</span> provide the option of processing
              documents that are not DTD or schema valid. However, processors <span class="keyword">may</span>
              require DTD or schema validity as their default setting. For example, a document that
              uses a DTD that does nothing other than provide default attribute values cannot be DTD
              valid (because the DTD does not declare any content models) but is processable as a
              DITA document as long as the DTD declarations are processed.</p>

            <p>Conforming DITA processors <span class="keyword">must</span> be able to process all conforming
              DITA documents, but they are <span class="keyword">not required</span> to support all features

              a given relationship instance or type is variable with defaults for most or all of the
              DITA-defined link types.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Required and invariant.</p>

            <p>This is a special case of linking where there is less room for variance. In
              particular, the effective value of resolving a conref <span class="keyword">must</span> be
              invariant for a given pair of elements processed in a given map and dita value
              context. However, the rendition result for a content reference <span class="keyword">may</span>
              vary.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Variable with or without defaults.</p>

            <p>Includes all features that relate to how a given element looks or behaves
              interactively in the context of a particular rendition type. It is mostly bound to
              element types, e.g., lists must have a list nature, tables should have tabular nature,
              etc. Rendition is either rendition-specific with defaults or rendition specific. </p>

            <p>While wide variation in rendition is possible, there is an intent that the rendition
              of a given element type be consistent with its core semantic. For example, a "pre"
              element <span class="keyword">should not</span> be rendered as flowing text unless it can be
              shown that the particular rendering is consistent with the basic semantic of "pre". In
              these cases the intent of the specification is often expressed through definition of
              variable with defaults rendering effects.</p>
