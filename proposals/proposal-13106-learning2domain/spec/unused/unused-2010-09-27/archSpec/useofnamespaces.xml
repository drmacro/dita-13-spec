<p>DITA elements are never in a namespace. Only the DITAArchVersion
attribute is in a       DITA-defined namespace. All other attributes
are in no namespace.</p>
<p>This limitation is imposed by the details of the class attribute
syntax, which makes it       impractical to have namespace-qualified
names for either vocabulary modules or individual       element types
or attributes. Elements included as descendants of the DITA &lt;foreign>
element       type may be in any namespace.<note>For this reason,
domain modules that are intended for wide         use should take
care to define element type and attribute names that are unlikely
to         conflict with names used in other domains, for example,
by using a domain-specific prefix on         all names.</note></p>
