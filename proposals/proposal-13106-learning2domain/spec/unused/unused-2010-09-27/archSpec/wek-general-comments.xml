    <ol>
      <li>Current terminology section is good but needs to be expanded to include all DITA-specific
        jargon terms used in this spec or in the language spec.</li>
      <li>In terminology, break out shell DTD and head schema into separate terms.</li>
      <li>Should probably use glossary topics for terminology</li>
      <li>Define "constraints module" (or "constraint module")</li>
      <li>Define "vocabulary" as it is used in the discussion of specialization and constraints. </li>
      <li>The current constraints draft use the term "vocabulary module". Is this a formal term or
        should it be replaced?</li>
      <li>Constraints are orthogonal to specializationâ€”moved that discussion into the "creating a
        custom document type" section, although the organization needs more refinement.</li>
