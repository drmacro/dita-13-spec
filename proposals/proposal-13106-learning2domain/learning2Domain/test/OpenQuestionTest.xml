        <lcQuestion2>
          <p>The Level Landscaping Company sends a three member team whenever there's a big job to
            do. The team assigned to today's landscaping job has an interesting way of dividing up
            the work. Nicky has only nine months of experience and has to take care of 1/4 of the
            yard. Karen has worked for the company longer and is assigned 1/3 of the yard. Peter has
            been with the company the longest and must care for the remaining 600 square feet.</p>
          <p>What is the area of the yard in square feet?</p>
        </lcQuestion2>
        <lcOpenAnswer2>1440</lcOpenAnswer2>

          <p>I'm sorry, you are wrong. To solve this word problem, follow these steps:<ol
              id="ol_dyq_bq2_hk">
              <li>Determine what fraction of the yard Peter is caring for.<ol id="ol_dhc_fq2_hk">
                  <li>Peter's fraction = 1-(Nicky's fraction)-(Karen's fraction)<p>Peter's fraction
                      = 1 - 1/4 - 1/3</p></li>
                  <li>Convert all fractions to a common denominator:<p>1 = 12/12</p><p>1/4 =
                      3/12</p><p>1/3 = 4/12</p></li>
                  <li>Solve<p>12/12-3/12-4/12 = 5/12</p></li>
                </ol></li>
              <li>Determine the size of the yard.<ol id="ol_imy_kq2_hk">
                  <li>600 = 5/12 of x</li>
                  <li>7200 = 5x</li>
                  <li>x = 1440</li>
                </ol></li>
            </ol></p>
