        <lcQuestion2>Read the selection and answer the question.<p>Amelia Earhart, born in Atchison,
            Kansas, on July 24, 1897, recorded many ﬁrsts in aviation history before attempting her
            greatest feat of all—the ﬁrst round-the-world ﬂight via the equator. Earhart carefully
            mapped her route, originally heading west from Oakland, California, only to crash in
            Hawaii. </p><p>She survived, but her Lockheed Electra 10E plane was shipped back and
            repaired. On May 21, 1937, Earhart set off again, this time heading east. The trip was
            going well, with all America watching and waiting to hear news of her progress. But, on
            one of the last legs of her 30,000-mile trip, 20 hours after leaving New Guinea with her
            navigator, Fred Noonan, Earhart was lost. </p><p>On July 2, 1937, the U.S. Coast Guard
            cutter Itasca intercepted brief, desperate transmissions for help. But the ship couldn’t
            home in on her navigational position and problems with Earhart’s radio left her unable
            to receive messages. </p><p>Over sixty years after her disappearance, and over 100 years
            after her birth, no one knows what really happened. No trace of her plane was ever
            found. Stories about her tragic end are still being talked about and investigated. The
            most widely accepted theory is that she ran out of gas, crashed and drowned. Other
            accounts have Earhart and her navigator straying off course on purpose to go on a secret
            spy mission for President Franklin Roosevelt.</p><p> Currently, a group of researchers
            is combing a desolate island in the Paciﬁc Ocean called Nikumaroro. They have found
            intriguing clues: the heel of a woman’s shoe that matches Earhart’s size, and pieces of
            aluminum and parts that may have come from her plane.</p><p>What problem made it almost
            impossible for the Coast Guard to locate Amelia Earhart?</p></lcQuestion2>

            <lcAnswerContent2>The Coast Guard was too far away from Amelia
              Earhart.</lcAnswerContent2>

        </lcAnswerOptionGroup2>
        <lcFeedbackIncorrect2>
          <p>Answer C is correct. The article states that the problems with Earhart's radio left her
            unable to receive messages.</p>
          <p>Answer A is incorrect because in Paragraph 3, we read that the Coast Guard cutter
            Itasca intercepted brief, desperate transmissions for help.</p>
          <p>Answer B is incorrect because her navigator was on board the plane with her. </p>
          <p>Answer D is incorrect because we are told that the ship did not know where Earhart was;
            the distance from Earhart is unknown. </p>
