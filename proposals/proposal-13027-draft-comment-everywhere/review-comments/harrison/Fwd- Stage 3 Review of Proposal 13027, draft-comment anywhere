Subject: Fwd: Stage 3 Review of Proposal 13027, draft-comment anywhereDate: Wednesday, July 24, 2013 5:59 PMFrom: Nancy Harrison <nancylph@gmail.com>To: Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com>Conversation: Stage 3 Review of Proposal 13027, draft-comment anywhereHi Eliot,Here's the original mailNancy---------- Forwarded message ----------From: Nancy <nancylph@gmail.com>Date: Fri, Jun 28, 2013 at 9:14 AMSubject: Re: Stage 3 Review of Proposal 13027, draft-comment anywhereTo: Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com>Cc: Jim Tivy <jimt@bluestream.com>, Kristen James Eberlein<kris@eberleinconsulting.com>Hi Eliot,I looked at the latest proposal, and have one trivial comment and one concern.Trivial comment:The very first bullet item says "Add <draft-comment> to the followingplaces that do not allow it in 1.2:"     That should include the phrase 'and <required cleanup>', I assume.Concern:Eliot, you made it clear that the proposal hadn't changed from the onethat was approved by the TC, except for the actual DTD code, so weonly needed to look at that.  But I can't help but think that part ofthe reason for assigning reviewers is to have people paying reallyconcentrated attention to proposals, and in paying really focusedattention to this one, an aspect of it came to my notice that hadn'tbefore, so I feel I need to bring it up, even though the proposalpassed Stage 2 this way.Basically, I'm concerned about the changes to the highlighting domain,and codeph.content from their current models to ph.content.  I assumethis is to facilitate future changes by including txt.inclautomatically.  But it ends up adding indexterm/indextermref, as wellas image, to highlight domain elements and codeph, which I think isunwise.  I can't ever see a reason for highlighting or codeph elementsto include those things.  I think it makes more sense to simply addthe 2 elements draft-comment/required-cleanup to the currentdefinitions of the highlighting elements and codeph.content, as you'redoing with most of the other elements/entities you're changing, ratherthan completely redefining them. (btw, I went back to the minuteswhere this proposal was discussed, and this piece of it doesn't everseem to have come up; mea culpa for not paying close enough attentionat the time.)Comments on code:As far as I can tell, the code looks fine, modulo my concerns aboutthe highlightDomain.mod and programmingDomain.mod changes..Kris, what do you think about this type of situation? The TC can'tafford to be revisiting every proposal after approving them, but OTOH,why assign reviewers if not to have them put extra time and thoughtinto the proposals they review?Regards,NancyOn Fri, Jun 28, 2013 at 3:34 AM, Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com> wrote:> Nancy and Jim,>> Thank you for agreeing to review this proposal.
