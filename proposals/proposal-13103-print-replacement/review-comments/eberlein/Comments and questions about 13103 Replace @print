Subject: Comments and questions about 13103 Replace @printDate: Friday, June 28, 2013 2:06 PMFrom: Kristen James Eberlein <kris@eberleinconsulting.com>To: Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com>Conversation: Comments and questions about 13103 Replace @print    In the <shortdesc>, should be "general" instead of "generate" Are you suggesting that the OASIS doc-type shells include a subjectScheme map which defines permissible values for the @deliveryTarget attribute? OK, I see that the subjectScheme map calls out that the values are illustrative and not normative. In the RelaxNG declarations, do you have duplicate <grammar> elements?  Best, Kris  Kristen James Eberlein Principal consultant, Eberlein Consulting Co-chair, OASIS DITA Technical Committee Charter member, OASIS DITA Adoption Committee www.eberleinconsulting.com <http://www.eberleinconsulting.com>  +1 919 682-2290; kriseberlein (skype)   On 6/17/2013 1:10 PM, Eliot Kimber wrote:   Submitter's message HTML version  -- Eliot Kimber     Document Name: Proposal 13103 Replace @print (HTML) <https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/dita/document.php?document_id=49567>   Description Proposal for adding a new conditional attribute domain, deliveryTarget, as a functional replacement for the @print attribute.  Download Latest Revision <https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/dita/download.php/49567/latest/proposal-13103-print-replacement.html>  Public Download Link <https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=49567&wg_abbrev=dita>   Submitter: Eliot Kimber Group: OASIS Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) TC Folder: Drafts Date submitted: 2013-06-17 10:10:06
