<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Original requirement</h2><div class="p">Original requirement as posted to the DITA TC mailing list 26 May 2009 by W.
        Eliot
        Kimber:<pre class="pre codeblock">On Friday, in the context of designing a new specialization for a client, I
noticed that section-div is not allowed within li.

I'm not sure what the finally-approved proposal said but it was certainly my
intent/assumption that section-div would be allowed essentially anywhere &lt;p&gt;
is allowed.

By that logic, I would be inclined to argue that the lack of section-div in
li (and similar elements, e.g., dd, etc.) is a bug. Having forgotten the
original discussion and thinking only of the base semantics of section-div,
I found it surprising that it was not included in li.</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">The general requirement is to have a generic, non-section-containing,
        division element that can occur in any context, removing the need to
        have different specializations for the same specialized semantic. The
        &lt;section-div&gt; element, because it cannot contain &lt;section&gt;, is
        appropriate for use in any block context and therefore satisfies the
        requirement if it is allowed essentially wherever &lt;p&gt; is allowed.</p>

      <p class="p">Another related requirement is the ability to have division elements in
        topic abstracts, in particular, in glossary entries, as the base type
        for the &lt;glossdef&gt; element is &lt;abstract&gt;, not &lt;body&gt;. Thus,
        having defined a specialization of &lt;bodydiv&gt; or &lt;sectiondiv&gt;,
        there is no way to use that specialization in glossary entries in DITA
        1.2.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Use cases</h2><div class="p">The *-div elements are intended to enable the creation of specialized element
        structures that may have arbitrarily complex structure and that are not
        explicitly titled (meaning that there is no provision for authors to
        specify titles). Primary use cases include:<ol class="ol" id="IssueNumber00__ol_fr4_mjq_bf">
        <li class="li">Enabling replication of legacy markup structures in DITA documents
          where the markup structures are not titled.</li>

        <li class="li">As the base types for question markup as defined in the DITA 1.2
          Learning and Training modules. If the bodydiv and sectiondiv elements
          had been defined at the time the L&amp;T design was finalized, they
          would have been used instead of &lt;fig&gt;, which was the closest DITA
          1.1 provided to a generic container.</li>

        <li class="li">Structures within topic bodies or sections that group several
          block-level elements together for a common purpose. Examples include
          the DITA for Publishers &lt;body-pullquote&gt; and &lt;section-pullquote&gt;
          elements, which simply contain one or more block-level elements as a
          quote that may be presented out of the main flow, as well as the
          &lt;epigraph&gt; element, which binds one or more block elements with the
          optional &lt;epigraph-attribution&gt; element.</li>

        <li class="li">Complex data structures in technical documentation, such as
          structured data values documented in reference information or in
          descriptions of complex hardware components.</li>

        </ol>
</div>

      <p class="p">Note that case (3) demonstrates the problem in the 1.2 design: the pull
        quote semantic does not include the need for section elements within the
        pull quote and therefore &lt;sectiondiv&gt; would serve as the base
        specialization in all possible occurrence contexts, but because
        &lt;sectiondiv&gt; is not allowed in &lt;body&gt;, it is necessary to have two
        variants, &lt;body-pullquote&gt; and &lt;section-pullquote&gt; in order to
        satisfy the requirement that only specializations of &lt;bodydiv&gt; can
        occur in &lt;body&gt; and only specializations of &lt;sectiondiv&gt; can occur
        in &lt;section&gt;.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits</h2><div class="p">Address the following questions:<ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">Who will benefit from this feature? Anyone who needs to create
          specialized div-type structures for which &lt;section&gt; is not needed
          (and therefore do not need to be limited &lt;body&gt;). Immediate and
          obvious beneficiaries would be the L&amp;T vocabulary, which could
          define new question elements specialized from &lt;sectiondiv&gt; rather
          than &lt;fig&gt; and DITA for Publishers, removing the need for the
          otherwise unnecessary &lt;body-pullquote&gt;/&lt;section-pullquote&gt;
          distinction, allowing a generic &lt;pullquote&gt; element.</li>

     <li class="li">What is the expected benefit? Specializations and their generation and
          authoring would be easier by avoiding the need to have two
          specializations only allowed in specific contexts when one would
          suffice. It would be possible to include divs in abstracts, and
          specifically glossary entries, where today they are not allowed.</li>

     <li class="li">How many people probably will make use of this feature? All users of
          the DITA for Publishers vocabulary, all users of a new-and-improved
          L&amp;T vocabulary, anyone specializing from &lt;sectiondiv&gt;.</li>

     <li class="li">How much of a positive impact is expected for the users who will make
          use of the feature? This is a significant positive impact for users
          that need it. It reduces definitional, authoring, and data conversion
          complexity and, in the case of abstracts and other block contexts
          where &lt;sectiondiv&gt; is not today allowed, makes the impossible
          possible.</li>

    </ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Costs</h2><div class="p">Outline the impact (time and effort) of the feature on the following groups:<ul class="ul">

            </ul>
</li>

       <li class="li">How many existing topics will need to be edited?<ul class="ul" id="IssueNumber00__ul_c3k_4mq_bf">
            <li class="li">17 topics will need to be updated: one for each element type
              whose content model is updated to allow &lt;sectiondiv&gt; plus the
              entry for &lt;sectiondiv&gt; itself.</li>

            </ul>
</li>

       <li class="li">Will the feature require substantial changes to the information
            architecture of the DITA specification? If so, what?<ul class="ul" id="IssueNumber00__ul_p1f_pmq_bf">
            <li class="li">No change the information architecture. The semantic of
              &lt;sectiondiv&gt; is not affected, only the places where it is
              allowed.</li>

            </ul>
</li>

      </ul>
</li>

     <li class="li">Vendors of tools: XML editors,component content management systems,
          processsors, etc.<ul class="ul" id="IssueNumber00__ul_1hr_qmq_bf">
          <li class="li">Tools that provide special processing for &lt;sectiondiv&gt; and for
            some reason depend on it being only within &lt;section&gt; would need
            to be updated. It seems unlikely that there are any such tools as
            unspecialized &lt;sectiondiv&gt; has no semantic beyond containment and
            has no default or expected presentation effect.</li>

          </ul>
</li>

     <li class="li">DITA community-at-large. Will this feature add to the perception that
          DITA is becoming too complex? Will it be simple for end users to understand?<ul class="ul" id="IssueNumber00__ul_xc2_5mq_bf">
          <li class="li">This feature should not add to the perceived complexity of DITA.
            At worst it is neutral, at best it removes complexity by aligning
            content rules with intuitive user expectation (that &lt;sectiondiv&gt;
            is allowed in all block contexts).</li>
