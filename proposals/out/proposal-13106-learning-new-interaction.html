  <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Original requirement</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Our experience with instructional designers and publishers revealed that many
        questions require multiple block elements for the question statement
        ("prompt" or "stimulus" in instructional design parlance) and for
        feedback.  The DITA 1.2 interaction design only allows for a single
        paragraph question and single-paragraph feedback. This makes it
        impossible to use 1.2 interactions directly for such questions.</p>

  <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Benefits</h3>
    
    <div class="p">Address the following questions:
  <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">Who benefits?
     <ul class="ul"><li class="li">Anyone who needs to represent questions and answers
          with multi-paragraph questions or feedback. This includes all
          educational publishers and many, if not most, training
          developers.</li>

               <li class="li">All educational publishers have this requirement, essentially without
          exception. Many, if not most, training groups within enterprises have
          this requirement. Essentially, anyone who would otherwise use the
          Learning and Training vocabulary very likely has this
          requirement.</li>

     <li class="li">This would provide a significant benefit to all users of the Learning
          and Training vocabulary.</li>

     </ul>

     </li>

     <li class="li">What are the benefits?
     <ul class="ul"><li class="li">The proposed markup makes it possible to use DITA learning
          markup directly for all questions without restriction, making it
          easier to adopt the use of DITA for educational publishing and
          instructional design by removing the need to design workarounds or
          non-standard vocabulary for interactions.</li>

     </ul>

     </li>

    </ul>

   </div>

   </div>

     <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Costs</h3>
       
       <div class="p">Outline the impact (time and effort) of the feature.
     <ul class="ul">
     <li class="li">Requires updates to the learningInteractionBase and learningDomain
          vocabulary modules, both DTD and XSD, and integrate them with the rest of the DITA modules for 1.3.
          <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> SC member Eliot Kimber has completed draft updates for the DTD modules as part of this proposal.</div>
</li>

     <li class="li">Editors of the DITA specification:<ul class="ul">
       <li class="li">Will require update to the prose of the existing lcInteractionBase
              element type.</li>

            <li class="li">Definition of the new lcInteractionLabel element type</li>

       <li class="li">Update of any language that makes specific reference to the content
              of interaction questions, feedback, etc., should there be
              any.</li>

       <li class="li">No changes required to the general DITA architecture (although the proposal
            depends on the 1.3 &lt;div&gt; element)</li>

     </ul>

    </li>

    <li class="li">Vendors of tools: The element type names and semantics are unchanged.
            The only change is to the class hierarchy of elements. Tools that
            depended on these elements being specialized from &lt;p&gt; will have
            to change. However, because useful interaction processing would
            require direct handling of the elements in the learning domain, it
            is unlikely that any learning-domain-aware processor depends on the
            class hierarchy. Thus we expect there to be little or no effect on
            existing tools from the class hierarchy change. Tools may need to be
            adjusted to account for the new ability to have block elements
            within contexts that did not allow them in DITA 1.2. </li>

    <li class="li">Existing documents: All existing 1.2 documents that are valid with
            respect to the 1.2 learning domain and interaction base domain will
            continue to be valid.</li>

          <li class="li">Existing specializations: Existing specializations will need to be
            updated to reflect the change to the class hierarchy. This change is
            needed to make the specializations completely valid specializations.
            However, the content models of any existing specializations will be
            consistent with the content models in the 1.3 version of the
            learning domain and interactionBase domain</li>

 <div class="section"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Technical requirements</h3>
   
   <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> This section must be complete in order for the proposal to be
    approved.</div>

  <div class="p">This proposal makes the following changes to the existing Learning and
          Training interactionBase and learning domains:<ol class="ol" id="ref_use_cases__ol_2yv_csd_1g">
          <li class="li">The @id attribute lcInteractionBase is changed from required to
            optional. The Subcommittee determined that requiring IDs on all
            interactions is not necessary and many uses of interaction would
            never otherwise use IDs on interactions.</li>

          <li class="li">Adds the new element, lcInteractionLabel, which may be used as an
            alternative to &lt;title&gt; in interactions. The term "label" is
            intended to avoid any implication of title-like semantics and make
            it clearer that the label need not be distinguishing. </li>

          <li class="li">Element types that in the 1.2 learning domain are based on topic/p
            have their class hierarchies changed to be based on topic/div. The
            &lt;div&gt; element type is new in 1.3. It is a nesting container that
            allows the same content as body and section except &lt;section&gt;,
            &lt;bodydiv&gt;, or &lt;sectiondiv&gt;. Thus &lt;div&gt;'s content model is a
            superset of &lt;p&gt;'s, allowing all block-level elements as well as
            text and all phrase-level elements.</li>

          </ol>
</div>

  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This change to the class hierarchy without modification of the original
          element type names violates backward compatibility. The TC chose to
          allow this change as the least expensive alternative. This change was
          made after careful and thoughtful deliberation and was not decided
          lightly. The alternative would have been to define a parallel set of
          domains with distinct element types but identical semantics, whose
          only purpose would be to avoid the change in class hierarchy. The TC
          decided that the cost of new domain was higher than the potential cost
          to existing systems of changing the class hierarchy.  </div>

                  lcInteractionLabel may repeat. The repetition is allowed for

                  <li class="li">It allows for labels with different conditionality</li>

                  <li class="li">Because it is not a title, there's no compelling reason to
                    disallow repetition. For example, you might want specialized
