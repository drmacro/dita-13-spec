Subject: Upon further reflection (13044) ...Date: Friday, July 19, 2013 7:31 PMFrom: Tom Magliery <tom.magliery@justsystems.com>To: Eliot Kimber <ekimber@rsicms.com>Conversation: Upon further reflection (13044) ...I don't know if I'm confused here, but it seems like the new definition you give for %data.cnt;  <!ENTITY % data.cnt   "#PCDATA |   %basic.ph; |   %image; |   %object; |   %title;  ">  Does not match with the text of what your proposal says to do: Modify %data.cnt to allow %basic.ph;, remove element types already allowed by %basic.ph; The %data.cnt; in 1.2 looks like this: <!ENTITY % data.cnt   "%words.cnt; |   %image; |   %object; |   %ph; |   %title;  ">   and %words.cnt has these:   "#PCDATA |    %data.elements.incl; |    %foreign.unknown.incl; |    %keyword; |    %term;  But the data and foreign stuff does NOT appear to be in %basic.ph ... so it seems they are inadvertently omitted from your new definition of %data.cnt. This is the first time I've ever poked around in these entity defs in this much detail, so I don't know if I'm just overlooking something. mag
